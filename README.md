# NeuralNetworkProject
 A simple simple network project, implemented with TensorFlow

 This project shows the importance of having a good dataset when in comes to multiclass classification.
 The first step towards any machine learning project is to always look at the data. Most researchers in my opinion just stops at df.head() and making a histogram, but I believe there is a much better way to determining how good your data is.

 This project recommends two ways to determine reliablity - scatterplots and heatmaps.

 To use this project, simply use:
pip install -r requirements.txt
